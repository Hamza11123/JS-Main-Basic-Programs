For Hour Hand:-
    1.  As we know, we gotta rotate 360 Degrees for 12Hours, then:
            => for 12 Hours -> 360 Degrees
            => for '1' Hour -> 30 Degrees
            => for 'm' Hours -> (m*30) Degrees ---- factor-1 (for 'm' Hours)

    2.  Moreover, we don't want that the Hour-hand Changes INstantly, han?
        So, We're gonna make Another-Factor.. in terms of [Minutes] (as the minutes changes, the Hour-Hand would b "affected" just a little bit!)
            => for '1' Hour(60-minutes) -> 30 Degrees
            => for '1' Minute -> "(1/2) Degrees" 
            => for 'n' Minute -> n*(1/2) Degrees" ----- factor-2 (for 'n' minutes)
            now, add Both the factors to get [MORE-ACCURATE-ROTATION]

            Final:- for 'm' Hours -> ((m*30) + (n/2))Degrees

For Minute-Hand:-
    1.  We gotta rotate 360 Degrees (for / after-Completing-60 minutes)..
            => for '1' minute -> 1/2 Degrees
            Final:- for 'n' minutes -> n/2 Degrees

For Second-Hand:- 
    really similar to the Minutes-logic...
